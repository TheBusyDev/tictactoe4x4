# tictactoe4x4
A fantastic game - you can challange your computer to play __tictactoe__, on a *4x4* grid!! You can also set different levels of difficulty (and believe me, this game can be __literally impossible__ to win in hard mode!!).
PS: there are some *secret codes* added to enable debug mode or to interrupt the match.
